 * Note: This is a data model layer implementation not intended for direct consumption by end users. Therefore,
 * reporting database and other standard exceptions is fine for error-handling purposes. (An end-user API based on
 * this data model layer, on the other hand, shall probably want to throw its own errors in each and every
 * problematic situation that can and should be anticipated within the scope of its normal operation, so as to not
 * reveal to end-users technical, internal information (such as error codes and messages contained in
 * DatabaseExceptions) but, instead, provide error details in a more user-friendly, abstract or otherwise
 * appropriate form.) Thrown exceptions shall be declared and discussed in JavaDoc without exception (pun).
